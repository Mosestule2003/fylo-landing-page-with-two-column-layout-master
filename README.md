## My process

- This project is comprised of five sections;
 1. Page-one
 2. Page-two
 3. Page-three
 5. footer
 - I started off by breaking down the required components for each page.
 - Setting up the tools needed for the project followed.
 - In each section, I made use of custom names to best describe the type of content found in each container. eg(flex-container, grid-container).
- Mobile-first workflow.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

On the first grid-container, settting up the phone icon and respective background was a challenge. But with help from (https://www.stackoverflow.com) and (https://w3school.com). Secondly I left out the mobile drop down menu, due to not fully undertanding the process of setting it up. Any feedback how to go about this is much appreciated. 

### Useful resources

- [](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This helped me to understand fully how position absolute works. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
